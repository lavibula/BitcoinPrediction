    "- This data is time series it's sequential, so we don't use Cross-Validation or any of the model ML techniques to evaluate error. TimeSeriesSplit, which is a specific type of cross-validation technique used for time series data. It's important to use time-series cross-validation when dealing with sequential data to avoid training on future data. TimeSeriesSplit splits the data into folds, so that the folds with data from the previous past will be used as the training set, and the future data will only be used as the test set. For example, if we split the data into 3 folds, each fold would consist of:\n",
